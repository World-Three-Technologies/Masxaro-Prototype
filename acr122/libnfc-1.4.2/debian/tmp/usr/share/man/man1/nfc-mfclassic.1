MIFARE Classic tag is one of the most widely used RFID tags.

The firmware in the NFC controller supports authenticating, reading and writing
to/from Mifare Classic tags. This tool demonstrates the speed of this library
and its ease-of-use. It's possible to read and write the complete content of a
Mifare Classic 4KB tag within 1 second. It uses a binary Mifare Dump file (MFD)
to store the keys and data for all sectors.

Be cautious that some parts of a Mifare Classic memory are used for r/w access
of the rest of the memory, so please read the tag documentation before experimenting too much!
