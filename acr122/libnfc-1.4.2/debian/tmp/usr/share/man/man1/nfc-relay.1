.TH NFC-RELAY 1 "June 26, 2009"
.SH NAME
nfc-relay \- Relay attack command line tool based on libnfc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfc-relay
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfc-relay
is a utility that demonstrates a relay attack.

This tool requires two NFC devices. One device (configured as target) will
emulate an ISO/IEC 14443 type A tag, while the second device (configured as
initiator) will act as a reader. The genuine tag can be placed on the second
device (initiator) and the tag emulator (target) can be placed close to the
original reader. All communication is now relayed and shown in the screen on
real-time.

This tool has the same issues regarding timing as \fBnfc-emulate-uid\fP has,
therefore we advise you to try it against e.g. an OmniKey CardMan 5321 reader.
