.TH NFC-POLL 1 "June 26, 2009"
.SH NAME
nfc-poll \- Poll for one NFC target
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfc-poll
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfc-poll
is a utility for polling any available target (tags but also NFCIP targets)
using ISO14443-A, FeliCa, Jewel and ISO14443-B modulations.

This tool relies on a hardware polling feature of the PN532, it will display
available information retrieved from the tag.

.SH IMPORTANT
There are some well-know limits with this example:
 - Even with NDO_AUTO_14443_4A enabled (default),
.B nfc-poll
can miss ATS. That due to the way the PN532 use to poll for ISO14443 type A, it
will attempt to find ISO14443-4-only targets, then ISO14443-3. If your
ISO14443-4 target is present when PN532 looks for ISO14443-4-only, ATS will be
retrieved. But if your target enter the field during ISO14443-3, RATS will not
be sent and ATS not retrieved.
 - 
.B nfc-poll
can show up only one card while two are in field. That's due, again, to the way
the PN532 poll for targets. It will stop polling when one modulation got a
result, so if you have, for example, one ISO14443-3 (eg. Mifare Ultralight) and
one ISO14443-4 (eg. Mifare DESFire), it will probably return only the
ISO14443-4.
