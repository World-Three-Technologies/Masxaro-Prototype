.SH NAME
nfc-list \- List NFC targets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfc-list
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfc-list
is a utility for listing any available tags like ISO14443-A, FeliCa, Jewel
or ISO14443-B (according to the device capabilities).
It may detect several tags at once thanks to a mechanism called anti-collision
but all types of tags don't support anti-collision and there is some physical
limitation of the number of tags the reader can discover.

This tool displays all available information at selection time.
