.SH NAME
pn53x-sam \- PN53x SAM communication demonstration tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pn53x-sam
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pn53x-sam
is a utility attempt to test a simple connection with a SAM (Secure Access
Module) in several modes.

To run this utility you must have a SAM (like the NXP's P5CN072 chip)
successfully connected to your PN53x chip.

Warning: the SAM inside a Touchatag/ACR122U  is \fInot\fP hooked to the PN532
but to the intermediate controller so \fBpn53x-sam\fP won't work with a Touchatag/ACR122U.
