.SH NAME
nfc-anticol \- Demonstration of NFC anti-collision command line tool based on libnfc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfc-anticol
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfc-anticol
is an anti-collision demonstration tool for ISO/IEC 14443-A tags, performed by
custom constructed frames. The first frame must be a short frame which is only
7 bits long. Commercial SDK's often don't support a feature to send frames that
are not a multiple of 8 bits (1 byte) long.  This makes it impossible to do the
anti-collision yourself.  The developer has to rely on closed proprietary
software and should hope it does not contain vulnerabilities during the
anti-collision phase.  Performing the anti-collision using custom frames could
protect against a malicious tag that, for example, violates the standard by
sending frames with unsupported lengths.
Note that this is only a demonstration tool, which can not handle multiple tags
as real life anti-collisions with multiple tags generate "messy" bits which
are neither 0 nor 1.
